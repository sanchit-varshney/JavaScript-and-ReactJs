#  Javascript and Reactjs 
Hi I made this project in 7 Days.
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with instructor.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>JavaScript
<li>HTML
<li>React.js
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
